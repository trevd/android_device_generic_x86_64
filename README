A Note to all you forkers
=========================
This alone won't make x86_64 Android pop into life. It is one part of the puzzle



device/generic/x86_64
=====================

This repository contains a mini device specification which targets the x86_64 platform


A Self Deploying Prophecy ( or adding a new target platform) 
============================================================

You basically need a device specification ( this repo )

The build system needs
A Target combo file
AndroidConfig.h 
Target Arch Varient specification.

These files are installed from this repo when you run envsetup.sh
vendorsetup.sh takes care of this and it will keep everything together for now
